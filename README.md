# Portfolio
As A web developer
I WANT a deployed portfolio
SO THAT I can showcase my applications to potential employers and clients. 

This repository was created on 12/20/2019. It has three html files, one folder "assets" with two sub-folders: "css" and "images".

The background pattern "circuit" is downloaded from www.toptal.com/designers/subtlepatterns.

The image of favicon is  a png file.

            <p>Hello!</p>

            <p>
                My dream is to become a Full Stack Web Developer. I have a significant experience in Linguistics and
                Educational fields. Worked as a translator/interpreter in the watch company, translated into English two
                documentaries on a volunteer basis, have a professional experience as a substitute teacher in the
                international and public schools. <br>
                <br>
                Compelled to succeed in the technological world and to embrace the new computer languages. Excited to
                write the code, develop responsive websites as well as deliver outstanding and functional web
                experiences. <br>
                <br>
                I am currently earning a certificate in Web Development through Southern Methodist University while
                expanding skills in HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, Express.js, Node.js and MySQL. Positioned to
                contribute to teamwork with a personal
                passion for the details, critical thinking and excellent communication skills. Disciplined to do work
                with
                minimum supervision. <br>
                <br>
